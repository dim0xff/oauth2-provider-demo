h1. An OAuth Provider

* Provider owns a protected resource that belongs to a user. (password)
* Provider generates keys ( client_id, client_secret ) for OAuth clients.

h1. An OAuth Client

* Client wants to access the protected resource on an OAuth provider.
* Client knows its own client_id, and client_secret, redirect_uri

h1. Registration flow

* Register an oauth client with the "redirect_uri" and "application_name".
* Get the client_id and client_secret.

Now the oauth provider and oauth clients know about each other.
